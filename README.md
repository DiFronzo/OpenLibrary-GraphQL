## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

First of all, [download](https://deno.land/) and install **Deno**. Version `1.10` or higher is required.

Verify that the installation was successful by running the following command that should return the version number for Deno, v8 and TypeScript.

```bash
deno --version
```

To quickly start using the code run the following command. With the flag `--allow-net` that is allowing network access. 

```bash
deno run --allow-net https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiFronzo/OpenLibrary-GraphQL/main/mod.ts
```

GraphQL should now be running on [http://localhost:8080/graphql](http://localhost:8080/graphql).

That's all you need to know to start! üéâ
